A very warm welcome to all those who have landed here! :wave:
This open source community is made to ease the work of all the GGSIPU students who face difficulty in finding the resources related to practical file work. Here's a collection of resources that would help every engineering student to simplify the process of writing practical files. This repository is a collection of handwritten files for the students of GGSIPU.
 
 
##### To contribute follow the guidelines in [Contributors.md](Contributors.md) 
 
 
 
 **Everyone is welcome to [contribute](Contributors.md). Let's help each other by making little contributions and taking small initiatives.**

## Let's Contribute :sparkles:

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it]( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```
where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.


For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Practical-Files.git

```
where `Your_Username` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the Practical-Files repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd Practical-Files
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:
```
git checkout -b my-name
```

## Add files, make necessary changes and commit those changes


If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.


Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
git add <file_name>
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
```
git commit -m "your message"
```
replacing `<your-message>` with the changes that you've added.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a  `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Soon, I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

Your contribution matters. Thank you for contributing! :sparkles:
